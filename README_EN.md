## Experience

Please note that the description does not mention hard skills; they are listed separately in a dedicated section below. It seems that this will provide a complete understanding of what I can do at the moment, and there is no great need to specify what was done in each specific place.

### September 2024 - Present

- **Company:** Rosselkhozbank
- **Moscow, [rshb.ru](https://www.rshb.ru)**
- **Position:** Head of the Analytics Competence Center

I perform a similar role to the one I had at GPB. The situation is complicated by the fact that at the moment, the Competence Center is a nominal concept, and it is necessary to build it from scratch, which is what I am currently doing by introducing standards, approaches, etc.

### November 2022 — September 2024

- **Company:** Gazprombank, OJSC
- **Moscow, [www.gazprombank.ru](https://www.gazprombank.ru)**
- **Position:** Head of the Systems Analysis Department

In the role of department head, I performed the following tasks:

- Developing the department's development strategy
- Creating a competency matrix
- Establishing a regular assessment process
- Optimizing and standardizing the hiring process
- Direct participation in recruitment (conducting interviews and fit interviews)
- Implementing a review process for analytical articles
- Implementing a review process for test models from testers by analysts
- Conducting periodic one-on-one meetings with each employee to identify their needs, pains, and problems
- Creating and implementing mentorship and onboarding programs for new employees

In addition to the listed tasks, I participated in shaping the overall vision of the department's strategy, personally handled the adaptation of newcomers, and formed and maintained conceptual approaches to working with documentation.

I strive to maintain the most trusting relationships with each employee, participate in their work life, help build their career path, and solve their issues, not always work-related.

During my time at the bank, I earned a reputation as a person who answers any question, solves any task, does their job with the highest quality, and demands the same from others. I look at the product as a whole, perceive any task (e.g., analysis) as a product, expanding my area of responsibility and creating it for the consumer, not just "writing as I am used to."

### February 2022 — November 2022

- **Company:** Gazprombank, OJSC
- **Moscow, [www.gazprombank.ru](https://www.gazprombank.ru)**

In this role, I continued to perform the same tasks as in the position of a regular analyst.

Additionally, I took on the following responsibilities:
